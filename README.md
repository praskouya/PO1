# Object-Oriented Programming 1 Projects

This repository contains projects and assignments completed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming 1 course at Łódź University of Technology. The course aimed to master the basics of object-oriented programming and apply its principles in various projects.

## Contents

The repository includes the following projects:

### Project 1: Custom String Concatenation Function in C

Implementation of a function in C that takes two strings, allocates memory, and returns the concatenation of these strings without using functions from the `<string.h>` library.

### Project 2: Stack with Dynamic Memory Allocation

Implementation of a `Stack` class using dynamic memory allocation.

### Project 3: Complex Numbers

Implementation of a `Complex` class with one constructor, operators, and methods `abs()` to return the modulus of the complex number, `phase()` to return the phase of the complex number, and `conj()` to return the conjugate of the complex number.

### Project 4: Polynomials

Implementation of a `Polynomials` class. This project was realized without using standard library containers and with dynamic memory allocation.

### Project 5: Associative Array Pattern

Custom implementation of the `std::map` pattern. Examples of its use include:
- `Library.h` for creating a book database, where the key is the book title (`std::string`) and the value contains information about the book.
- `Employee.h` for storing employee information.
